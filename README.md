# CS255_System_Analysis
//This repository contains the DriverPass project and DriverPass is, of course, the client, the client wanted a system designed for people who are aiming to obtain a driver's license from the DVM but need to be scheduled on-road driving lessons and also take online classes and practice tests that conform to the policies and rules of the DVM. I did my best to depict all the requirements and functions of the system by using UML diagrams. I would like to revise the business requirement document and improve the nonfunctional requirement aspects of the system design. I interpreted the user's needs by depicting it with UML diagrams, for instance, the system design document has a UML use case diagram depicting all the use cases of the system. finally, I use process and object modeling to analyze and design the DriverPass system//
